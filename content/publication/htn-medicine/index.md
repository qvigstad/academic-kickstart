abstract: Ageing people with hemophilia (PWH) have a higher prevalence of hypertension than the general population. This study aimed to determine whether macroscopic hematuria was associated with hypertension in PWH in a post hoc analysis using data from a cross-sectional study conducted by the ADVANCE Working Group (the H3 study), which included PWH ≥ 40 years of age. Data from 16 contributing centers, located in 13 European countries and Israel, were analyzed using logistic regression models. Of 532 recruited PWH in the H3 study, 117 had hypertension and a positive family history of hypertension (hypertension FH+), 75 had hypertension and a negative family history of hypertension (hypertension FH-), 290 had no diagnosis of hypertension, and the remaining 50 had missing hypertension data. Logistic regressions showed that macroscopic hematuria was associated with hypertension FH+, both in the univariate (OR = 1.84 [1.17-2.90], P = .01) and in the multivariate model (OR = 1.80 [1.03-3.16], P = .04). Macroscopic hematuria was not associated with hypertension FH-. Moreover, in a multivariate logistic regression the odds of hypertension FH+ were increased with the number of macroscopic hematuria episodes. The association between macroscopic hematuria and hypertension was significant for PWH with a family history of hypertension.
