abstract: Introduction - Macroscopic hematuria is considered a significant risk factor for urologic disease, and it is highly prevalent in people with hemophilia. Aim - To determine whether prophylactic factor replacement therapy is associated with reduced occurrence of macroscopic hematuria in people with hemophilia in a post hoc analysis using data from a cross-sectional study conducted by the Age-Related Developments and Comobordities in Hemophilia (ADVANCE) Working Group that included males with hemophilia ≥40 years of age. Methods - Data from 16 contributing centers, in 13 European countries and Israel, were analyzed using logistic regression. Of 532 recruited individuals, this analysis included 370 patients with moderate or severe hemophilia who received on-demand or prophylactic therapy. Results - For patients with a history of macroscopic hematuria, we analyzed the association between prophylaxis and reoccurrence of macroscopic hematuria within the past 5 years (n = 235 patients). Frequent (≥3 times/wk) prophylaxis was negatively associated with a recent episode of macroscopic hematuria (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.76). We also analyzed whether prophylaxis corresponded to a lower lifetime number of macroscopic hematuria episodes (n = 285 patients). Frequent prophylaxis for >15 years was associated with a lower number of episodes compared to on-demand treatment (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.54), whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and severe hemophilia were associated with a higher number. There was no association of prophylaxis <3 times/wk with hematuria. Conclusion - Frequent prophylaxis was negatively associated with the number of episodes of macroscopic hematuria in people with hemophilia. Prevalence of macroscopic hematuria was higher among individuals with severe hemophilia and those regularly using NSAIDs.
